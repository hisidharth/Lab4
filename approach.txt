To invert a binary tree I used a recursive solution.

The goal of each recursive call is to switch the right subtree with the left subtree.

We can get to the lowest left subtree and right subtree with recursive calls 
and once we have set values for the right and left
we can swap the two.

this simple solution works because each root points to its childern meaning if we shift the 
position of the root, the children follow.

Added a print method just to output the tree so I can verify the solution.
